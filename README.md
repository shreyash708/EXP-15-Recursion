# EXP-15-Recursion

# Aim:
To implement and understand the concept of Recursion in C++ with practical examples including Factorial, Sum of Natural Numbers, String Reversal, and Integer Reversal.

# Theory:

Recursion is a process where a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem.

Every recursive function must have:

Base Case – A terminating condition to stop recursion.

Recursive Case – Function calls itself with a smaller subproblem.

Applications demonstrated:

Factorial of a number

Sum of first n natural numbers

Reversing a string

Reversing an integer

# Algorithm:

# Experiment 15 A – Factorial using Recursion
Start the program.
Define a function fact(int n) to calculate factorial.
Base case: If n <= 1, return 1.
Recursive case: Return n * fact(n-1).
Accept a number from the user.
Call the recursive function and display factorial.
End the program.

# Experiment 15 B – Sum of Natural Numbers using Recursion
Start the program.
Define a function sumup(int n) to calculate sum.
Base case: If n <= 1, return 1.
Recursive case: Return n + sumup(n-1).
Accept a number from the user.
Call the recursive function and display sum.
End the program.

# Conclusion
Successfully implemented recursion for solving problems in factorial, summation, and reversal operations.
Learned how recursion works with base case and recursive case.
Recursion provides an elegant solution for problems that can be broken down into smaller subproblems.
